# Singapore-flatprice-dataset

## Problem Description 
 
### Predict the Flat Resale Prices in Singapore 
 
Investing in Flats is the biggest investment for most households in cities like Singapore which is very small but heavily urbanised. Therefore, being able to accurately value the flat prices will not only facilitate market transactions by providing valuable guidance for all market participants (be it home owners, home buyers, landlords, tenants or banks that underwrite mortgages), but also provide useful insights for policy makers and government authorities in understanding the current state of the economy. 
 
In this competition, you are expected to create an analytical and modelling framework to predict the flat resale prices based on the quantitative and qualitative features provided in the dataset.
